## Project Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of computer vision and deep learning by building a model to classify images as cats or dogs. The model leverages the power of CNNs to extract features from images and perform classification tasks.

## Key Components
### Data Preparation:
* Utilizes TFDS for efficient access to a labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
* Implements ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation:
* Rotates images for viewpoint variation.
* Shifts images horizontally and vertically for robustness.
* Applies random shearing for distortion tolerance.
* Zooms in and out for scale invariance.
* Performs horizontal flips to increase data diversity.

### Model Architecture:
* Constructs a CNN model in Keras with sequential layers:
* Convolutional layers (Conv2D) to extract features from the images.
* MaxPooling layers (MaxPool2D) for downsampling and reducing computational cost.
* Employs Flatten and Dense layers for classification:
* Flattens the extracted features into a one-dimensional vector.
* Uses Dense layers with activation functions for classification.
* Integrates Dropout layers for regularization to prevent overfitting.

### Training and Validation:
* Splits the dataset into training and validation sets.
* Trains the model on the training data.
* Evaluates the model's performance on the validation set.


## Getting Started

### This project requires the following libraries:
* TensorFlow (tensorflow)
